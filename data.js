        <ol>
        <li>
        <strong>Understanding the useMemo Hook:</strong><br/>
        The useMemo hook is used to memoize the result of a function or computation so that it is only recomputed when its dependencies change. By caching the result, we can prevent unnecessary re-rendering and improve the overall performance of our React components. We'll start by discussing the basic syntax and usage of the useMemo hook.
        </li>
        <br/>

        <li>
        <strong>Using useMemo for Expensive Computations:</strong><br/>
        One of the primary use cases of useMemo is optimizing expensive computations. We'll explore an example where a complex calculation or data transformation is performed within a component, and how we can utilize useMemo to memoize the result and avoid redundant calculations.
        </li>
        <br/>

        <li>
        <strong>Memoizing Component Props:</strong><br/>
        In certain scenarios, a component may receive props that are computationally expensive to derive. We'll demonstrate how useMemo can be used to memoize these derived props, ensuring that they are only recalculated when the underlying dependencies change, thus reducing unnecessary re-renders.
        </li>
        <br/>

        <li>
        <strong>Caching API Responses with useMemo:</strong><br/>
        Fetching data from APIs is a common task in React applications. We'll explore how to use useMemo to cache API responses, ensuring that subsequent renders don't trigger additional requests, ultimately improving the responsiveness and perceived performance of our application.
        </li>
        <br/>

        <li>
        <strong>Memoizing Callback Functions:</strong><br/>
        Callback functions passed down to child components can cause unnecessary re-renders if not memoized correctly. We'll discuss how useMemo can be employed to memoize these callbacks, preventing unnecessary re-renders and optimizing the performance of our application.
        </li>
        <br/>

        <li>
        <strong>When to Use useMemo vs. useCallback:</strong><br/>
        The useCallback hook is often confused with useMemo since both are used to memoize values. We'll clarify the differences between the two hooks and explain when to use useMemo over useCallback and vice versa, depending on the specific use case.
        </li>
        <br/>

        <li>
        <strong>Performance Considerations and Pitfalls:</strong><br/>
        While useMemo can significantly improve performance, improper usage can lead to unintended consequences. We'll explore some common pitfalls and considerations when using useMemo, such as avoiding excessive memoization, dealing with complex dependencies, and understanding the trade-off between memory and computation.
        </li>
        <br/>
        </ol>

        <strong>Conclusion:</strong>
        The useMemo hook is a powerful optimization tool in React that enables developers to memoize expensive computations and prevent unnecessary re-renders. By utilizing useMemo strategically, we can improve the performance and responsiveness of our React components, resulting in a smoother and more efficient user experience. Remember to identify appropriate scenarios for memoization, understand the dependencies correctly, and measure the performance gains to make informed decisions. So, leverage the power of useMemo and take your React application's performance to new heights.

            <br/>
            <li><strong>Establishing a Connection:</strong></li>
            <ul>
            <li>The client-side code includes the Socket.IO library and initiates a connection to the server.</li>
            <li>The server-side code also includes the Socket.IO library and listens for incoming connections.</li>
            </ul>

            <li><strong>Emitting and Handling Events:</strong></li>
            <ul>
            <li>Once the connection is established, clients and servers can emit and listen for events.</li>
            <li>Clients can emit custom events with optional data, and servers can listen for these events and respond accordingly.</li>
            <li>Similarly, servers can emit events to clients, and clients can listen and react to those events.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <li><strong>Real-Time Communication:</strong></li>

            <li>WebSocket allows for full-duplex communication, enabling both clients and servers to send and receive data simultaneously.</li>
            <li>If WebSocket is not supported by the client or server, Socket.IO falls back to alternative transport mechanisms, such as long polling, to maintain real-time communication.</li>
            </ul>
            </ol>
            <br/>

            <strong>Use Cases of Socket.IO:</strong>
